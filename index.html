                    <p>Hello everyone I am a sophomore at BRCC studying entertainment technology! I also play for the BRCC softball team which keeps me pretty busy. After my two years here at BRCC I am planning on doing the Disney College Program and hopefully furthuring my career in the film industry. I am from New Orleans, Louisiana where I went to a catholic all girls school, called Mount Carmel Academy. One goal I have in mind is that I want to travel the world and film my own adventure!</p>
